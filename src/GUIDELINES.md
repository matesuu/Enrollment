# GUIDELINES FOR PUSHING CHANGES


In order to consider whether or not you should push a given change to a file, first consider if all of the following criteria are met:

1. The files do not generate any compile errors and can be compiled into a .class file without issue
2. After running said .class file, the resulting execution does not generate any exceptions
3. The functionality of the given file/program performs as specified by the design requirements
4. If applicable, the set of unit tests given must be met.

If any of the criteria listed above is not met, it is strongly discouraged that you not push to "main" given that it may disrupt workflow by replacing working code with a buggy and/or dysfunctional product.
